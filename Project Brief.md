Project Brief: Business Entity Resolution Tool
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-08-28

1. Project Vision & Goal
To build a business entity resolution tool that enables organizations to streamline their customer onboarding process. The service will verify, locate, and assess the risk profile of businesses, focusing initially on providing a simple, API-first solution for basic KYB/AML compliance.

2. Market & Competitive Analysis
The market requires fast, reliable, and developer-friendly tools for Know Your Business (KYB) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. Key competitors like SavvyIQ.ai and others focus on data aggregation, risk signal detection (sanctions, adverse media), and UBO mapping. Our opportunity is to provide a highly focused, API-first MVP that excels at core compliance checks with a superior developer experience.

3. Target Audience (MVP)
The primary user persona is 'Alex, the Backend Developer' at a fast-growing company. Alex needs to quickly integrate a reliable compliance tool into their existing onboarding workflow via a well-documented API. A secondary persona is the 'Compliance Officer' who will use a simple web dashboard for manual lookups and case review.

4. MVP Scope
In Scope:
API-First Core Verification (Legal Name, Address, Status)

Essential Regulatory Screening (Sanctions & PEP Lists)

Simple, Actionable Risk Output via API (e.g., 'Clear', 'Review Required')

Minimalist Investigator Dashboard for manual lookups

Out of Scope:
Adverse Media Screening

Full Corporate Hierarchy & UBO Mapping

Continuous Monitoring and Alerting
