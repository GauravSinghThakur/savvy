# Web App (React) â€“ Placeholder Scaffold

This directory contains a minimal React placeholder to validate project wiring.
For a full setup, initialize with Vite and install dependencies.

Quick start (recommended):
1) npm create vite@latest web -- --template react
2) cd web && npm install
3) npm run dev

Notes:
- VITE_API_BASE_URL: set to the backend origin (e.g., http://localhost:8000).
- See inline comments in `src/App.jsx` and `src/main.jsx` for structure.
- package.json does not include comments by design; this README explains fields.
