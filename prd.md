Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Business Entity Resolution Tool (MVP)
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-08-28

1. Product Goal & Vision
The goal of the MVP is to provide organizations with a fast, reliable, API-driven tool to perform essential business verification and meet fundamental KYB/AML compliance requirements during customer onboarding.

2. Primary User Persona
Persona: Alex, the Backend Developer

Role: Works at a fast-growing fintech startup that needs to automate its business onboarding process.

Goal: To integrate a third-party service that can quickly verify a new business customer and flag any major compliance risks.

Needs & Pains:

Needs a simple, well-documented REST API.

Wants a fast and reliable service with clear, actionable responses.

Is not a compliance expert and wants the service to handle the core compliance logic.

3. Functional Requirements (MVP)
3.1. Business Verification Endpoint
As Alex, I want to make a single, secure API call providing a business name and country.

So that I receive a structured JSON response containing the business's verified legal name, address, and registration status.

3.2. Automated Compliance Screening
As Alex, I want the API response to automatically include flags indicating if the business or its principals appear on key sanctions and Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) lists.

So that our system can automatically route high-risk applications for manual review.

3.3. Simple, Actionable Risk Status
As Alex, I want to receive a top-level, simplified status field in the API response (e.g., "status": "clear" or "status": "review_required").

So that I can easily build logic in our onboarding workflow to either approve the customer or create a case for the compliance team.

3.4. Developer-Friendly Documentation
As Alex, I need access to clear, comprehensive, and interactive API documentation with copy-pasteable code examples.

So that I can integrate the service with minimal friction.

4. Non-Functional Requirements (MVP)
Performance: The API response time for a standard verification check should be under 3 seconds.

High Availability: The service must have an uptime of 99.9%.

Security: All API endpoints must be secured via industry-standard authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0 or API Keys). All data at rest and in transit must be encrypted.
